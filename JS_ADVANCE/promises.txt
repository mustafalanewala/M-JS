Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

States of a Promise:
Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise now has a resolved value.
Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason (error).
