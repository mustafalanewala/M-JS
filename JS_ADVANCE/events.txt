An event is an action that happens in the browser, such as a user clicking a button, typing in an input field, or hovering over an element.
Events can be triggered by user actions, like mouse clicks, keyboard input, or programmatically using JavaScript.

Event Listener: Use addEventListener() to bind events to elements.

Event Object: Provides properties like type, target, timestamp, defaultPrevented.

Event Types :
Mouse Events: click, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout, mousemove
Keyboard Events: keydown, keyup, keypress
Focus Events: focus, blur
Form Events: submit, change, input, reset
Window Events: load, resize, scroll
Touch Events: touchstart, touchend, touchmove

Event Propagation:
Bubbling: Events propagate from the target element up.
Capturing: Events propagate from root down (use true in addEventListener).

Event Delegation: Attach a single listener to a parent element to handle child elements' events.

Stop Propagation: Use event.stopPropagation() to stop events from bubbling or capturing.

Throttling/Debouncing: Techniques to limit the frequency of event handler executions.
