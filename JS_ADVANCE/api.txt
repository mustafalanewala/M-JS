API (Application Programming Interface) requests allow communication between client-side JavaScript applications and back-end services.

Types of API Requests:
GET: Retrieve data from the server.
POST: Send data to the server to create a resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource on the server.
DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.

Making API Requests:
There are two primary ways to make API requests in JavaScript:

Using fetch:
The fetch API is built into modern browsers and is used to make network requests.

Using Axios:
Axios is a popular third-party library for making HTTP requests. It simplifies the syntax and provides additional features.
